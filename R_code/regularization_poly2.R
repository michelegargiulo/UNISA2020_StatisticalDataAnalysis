# The model.matrix() function is particularly useful for creating x; not only does it produce a matrix 
# corresponding to the 15 predictors but it also automatically transforms any qualitative
# variables into dummy variables (approved).
# The latter property is important because glmnet() can only take numerical, quantitative inputs.
